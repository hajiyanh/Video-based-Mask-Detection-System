# Video-based-Mask-Detection-System
## Objective:
The main purpose of this project is to develop a video-based mask detection system to distinguish whether a person is wearing a mask or not by getting input from the user's camera.
## Problem Description:
Due to the current situation during the COVID-19 pandemic, face mask detection has seen significant progress in Image processing and Computer vision. As a response to the COVID-19 pandemic, wearing a mask in public settings is an effective way to keep the communities safe.

In this project, we considered a Face-Mask Detection problem to detect if people are wearing a mask or not.
